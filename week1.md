# Scaleable Systems

## Lecture 2 and 3

Last Lecture Computer Systems - all software, see lecture

### 

- Processor (CPU, GPU, etc.)
    - Hardware to orchestrate and execute instructions to manipulate data as specified by a program



Firmware is baked into the hardware. Usually doesn't update, rarely bother to update.

Operating Systems, updates are frequency, allows for iterrelated programs to work together to enable application software

Application software is like things that run ontop of os

### Digital Data Representation

What is Data?

The idea was tracking how much to pay for telephones. Through cable length, words, electricty consumption

Binary is best way, using voltages (not quantam computers), low and high voltage, reliable on noisy unreliable wires

Base 2 Number Representation, challenge how to represent fractions and binary numbers

8 bits called a byte

Base 16, hexadecimal number representation, biggest number 8 bits can represent, color code

`0x` is showing hexadecimal


100 mbs for wifi, its 100 megabits, 12.5 megbytes 

why bytes?

cpu cannot address anything smaller than a byte


Understanding hardware can allow for more efficient programs.

How does opperating system translate programs into execution.
